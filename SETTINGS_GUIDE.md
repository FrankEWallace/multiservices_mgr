## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Complete Your Profile First
Before adding data, set up your company branding. This ensures all exports and reports look professional from day one.

Stick to one currency and date format throughout. Mixing formats causes confusion.

### 3. Review Settings Monthly
Business changes? Update your settings:
- New fiscal year?
- Changed working days?
- Updated contact info?

### 4. Test Export Features
After setting up, generate a test report to ensure:
- Company name appears correctly
- Currency formats properly
- Contact info is complete

### 5. Enable Useful Notifications
Start with all notifications ON, then disable ones you don't need.

## 🔐 Security Note

**Your settings are private**. Only you and authorized administrators can view or modify company settings.

Public settings (like currency symbol) are visible to help with data display, but sensitive information (Tax ID, business rules) remains protected.
